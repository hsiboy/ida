The conventional logger was not designed to check the messages sent to 
it, so a creative attacker can insert misleading information into the
system log, eg:

echo -ne "<13>Dec 12 42:41:40 login[42]: ROOT LOGIN on \`tty7'\0" | idsasocket /dev/log

In contrast idsasyslogd will try to write proper time, process id and user
identity. This makes the logs more reliable and reduces chance that an 
attacker frames an innocent bystander.

Idsasocket assumes a stream unix domain socket.
