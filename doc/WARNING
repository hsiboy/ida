This a research system, which means neither the code nor the 
underlying concepts have been tested in the real world. 

This release is a partial rewrite of an older prototype and 
probably contains significant inconsistencies and omissions.
It is an alpha release.

I am the only person who has looked at the code sofar, and 
I am new to writing robust systems. 

I have not audited the code and am probably not qualified to 
do so because I am unlikely to spot my own mistakes.
