.SH NAME
idsaguardtty \- interactive access control using the terminal interface
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B idsaguardtty [-b] [-f
.I format
.B ] [ -F
.I "custom format"
.B ]
.I /path/to/unix/socket
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B idsaguardtty
opens a connection to a unix domain socket
previously bound by the 
.B idsa 
module
.BR mod_interactive (8)
making it possible to approve or reject the events
reported by the module. 
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -b
Enables ringing of terminal bell if a new event arrives
.IP "-f format"
Selects an alternate predefined output format. Possible
formats include
.IR ulm , 
.IR tulm ,
.IR syslog , 
.IR native , 
.I csv 
and 
.I xml
.IP "-F custom format"
Selects a custom output format
.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Unlike the primary sockets created by
.BR idsad (8),
the sockets of
.BR mod_interactive (8)
are not protected by internal 
.BR idsad (8) 
access controls. 
It is recommended that the sockets are 
created in a directory only accessible to
authorized users. Abnormal termination
of 
.B idsaguardtty
appears to confuse some kernel versions and
may result in stale half-open connections.
